        Moreover, education can help individuals to develop important character
        traits such as empathy, resilience, and a strong sense of social
        responsibility. By exposing individuals to diverse perspectives and
        experiences, education can promote tolerance, understanding, and respect
        for others, leading to greater harmony and cooperation within society.
