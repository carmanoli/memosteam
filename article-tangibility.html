          id="article-image"

      <p>
        Tangibility is important in S.T.E.A.M. because it allows us to see and
        interact with the products and solutions that are developed through this
        methodology. S.T.E.A.M. is an interdisciplinary approach that emphasizes
        practical application, and tangible products provide a concrete way to
        demonstrate the effectiveness of S.T.E.A.M. solutions.
      </p>

      <p>
        For example, when developing a new technology product, a tangible
        prototype can be developed to test its functionality and identify any
        potential issues or improvements that need to be made. This allows for
        iterative improvements and refinement of the product until it is ready
        for market.
      </p>

      <p>
        Additionally, tangibility allows for more effective communication and
        collaboration among team members and stakeholders. Tangible prototypes
        and products provide a shared language and visual representation that
        can be easily understood by all parties involved. This can help to align
        expectations and ensure that everyone is on the same page when it comes
        to the development of a solution.
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, tangibility also plays an important role in engaging and
        inspiring learners, particularly in S.T.E.A.M. education. Tangible
        products and experiments allow students to see the practical application
        of S.T.E.A.M. concepts and inspire them to pursue careers in these
        fields. Seeing the tangible results of their efforts can also boost
        their confidence and motivate them to continue exploring S.T.E.A.M.
        concepts and developing new solutions.
      </p>

      <p>
        In summary, tangibility is an important aspect of S.T.E.A.M. because it
        allows for practical application, effective communication and
        collaboration, and engagement and inspiration of learners.
